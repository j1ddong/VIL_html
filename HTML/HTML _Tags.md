   The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph
   
   A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space(a margin) before and after a paragraph

   The `<i>` tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in *italic*.
   
   <p>This is normal text - <i>and this is italic text</i></p>

```html
<p>This is normal text - <i>and this is italic text</i></p>. 
```

5. `<u>`
   
   The `<u>` tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text
