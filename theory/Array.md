# Array

> An array is a type of linear data structure that is defined as a collection of elements with same data type

### Operations

- **Traverse** − print all the array elements one by one. o(n)

- **Insertion** − Adds an element o(n)

- **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the given index. o(n)

- **<u>Search</u>** − Searches an element using the given index o(1)

# Linked List

> A linked list is a linear data structure which can store a collection of "nodes" connected together via links i.e. pointers.

### Operations

- **Insertion** − Adds an element
  
  - on the head o(1)
  
  - any other location o(n)

- **Deletion** − Deletes an element
  
  - on the head o(1)
  
  - any other location o(n)

- **Search** − Searches an element using the given key. o(n)

# Queue

> A **queue** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in the FIFO (First In First Out) principle where the first element inserted would be the first element to be accessed.

### Operations

- **enqueue** − insert an element at the back of the queue o(1)

- **dequeue** − removes an element present at the front of the queue o(1)

- **peek** − prints the element present at the front of the queue. o(1)

- **isfull** − check if the queue is full o(1)

# Stack

> A stack is a **linear data structure** where elements are stored in the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle where the last element inserted would be the first element to be deleted.

### Operations

- **Push** − add a new item on top of the stack o(1)

- **Pop** − remove the top item from the stack o(1)

- **isEmpty** − check if the stack is empty o(1)

- **size** − count the number of items on the stack o(1)
